Using feature selectors + ML algorithms (e.g. HOG+ SVM) and also CNNs, we create, train and optimise 5 different computer vision pipelines to analyse a dataset of cropped images showing faces. We compare models with a series of classification reports, confusion matrices, Cohen Kappa coefficient, Hamming Loss and other metrics (Precision, Recall etc. ) These models were tested on different images, and also a video showing humans performing day-to-day activities (CNN only). Our CNN showed the highest accuracy of 81%, and with further optimization, we can use these models to create scanners for pandemics.

Furthermore, we create two functions, a Face Mask Detection function and a Face Video Detector. The Face Video Detector involved displaying a video where the model deployed can detect whether or not the user has a face mask. A video pops up on the screen, with a green box indicating the face mask is fitted on properly, and a red box indicating the face mask is not fitted on. The Face Mask Detection function allowed for an image to be categorised based on 3 labels ({0: no mask, 1: mask partially on, 2: mask fully on}).
